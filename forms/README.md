# FORMS

## PHP GET & POST

both get and post creates an array, this arrays holds key/value pairs, where keys are the names of the form  controls and values and the input data from the users.

both `_GET` and `_POST` sends data to the current script.

though _GET method makes everything visible to everyone.

when you use post method, data becomes invisible to others.

## HTML VALIDATION

to validate your php data, pass all variables into `htmlspecialchars()`.

trim() - strips unnecessary characters
stripslashes() - remove backslashes.
