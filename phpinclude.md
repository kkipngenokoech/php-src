# PHP INCLUDE

include or require - it takes all the text/code/markup that exists in the specified files and copies it into the file that uses the include statement.

so you "include/require filename".

the difference between include and require is that include only gives a warning incase the file being imported has an error but the code will still go on an execute whereas the require only ends at the statement, if it has an error of execution it doesn't proceed to execution.
