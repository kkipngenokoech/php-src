# CONSTANTS

these are those variables that once defined cannot be changed or undefined.

for constant names, you don't have to use `$` you just start the name of your variable with a `_` or a letter.

constants are automatically global across the script.

## creating a php constant

we use the define() function.
`define(name, value, case-insensitive)`

1. name of the constant
2. value of the constant
3. default is false, thats it is case insensitive.

## PHP CONSTANT ARRAYS

We just use the define too

define(nameOfArray,[array it self], case-sensitive)`.
