# EXCEPTIONS

this is an object that describes an error or unexpected behaviour of a php script

this is the best way to stop a function when it comes across data that it cannot use.

## THROWING AN EXCEPTION

The throw statement allows a user defined function or method to throw an exception

when an  exception is thrown the next code will not be executed

every thrown exception has to be caught.

here you will try and catch the exception.

to define a throw error you: `throw new Exception("the error message")`

then on the catch statement you `catch(Exception $e)`
